# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page

![Design preview for the Fylo dark theme landing page challenge](./docs/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is my solution for this challenge made by Frontend Mentor. It was meant to be developed for the widths of 1440px and 375px but I tried to improve its responsiveness. I used HTML5, CSS Flexbox and Vanilla JS.
